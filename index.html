        <img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="PJ McCall">

        <p id="early">Born in Northeast Pennsylvania in small town called Tamaqua (tuh-MAH-qwah), I always thought of myself as a city boy displaced in a small coal region town. 
            With an acceptance to St. Joes University, I came to the Philadelphia region and never looked back. I have been living in the Philadelphia Area for over 
            10 years and have had the luxury of residing in many of the popular neighborhoods in the area - Northern Liberties, Fairmount, and now Graduate Hospital.</p>

        <p id="work">In my work career, I have held a few various positions. I started as an intern and underwriter in the Commercial Real Estate industry. Then,
                I took my first job as a P&L Financial Analyst at a marketing company. I soon realized that the Accounting world wasn't for me, and accepted a job offer
                at my current company, ClarionDoor. We are a growing startup in the software industry that specializes in insurance rating solutions.</p>

        <p id="interests">I am a fan of all Philadelphia sports teams with the Sixers being my 1a favorite. I have season tickets to the games, and I try to attend as many as possible during the season.
            I am also a big fan of both food and travel with my favorite lunch spot being Dizzengoff (hummus for days!) and my favorite city to travel to being London.</p>
